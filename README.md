# Automatic-Power-Factor-Correction-System
Adaptive Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) system designed to reduce power losses caused by poor power factor using an adaptive, digitally controlled capacitor bank. Includes system concept, simulation model, and project documentation.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project presents the design and simulation of an **Adaptive Automatic Power Factor Correction (APFC) system** developed as part of the **EE3204 – Engineering System Design** module at the **University of Moratuwa**.

The objective of the project is to reduce **power losses caused by poor power factor** in electrical installations by implementing an adaptive, digitally controlled reactive power compensation scheme.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the impact of poor power factor on power losses and system efficiency
- Design an adaptive APFC system capable of operating under varying load conditions
- Improve system power factor close to unity
- Reduce line current and associated I²R losses
- Validate system behavior through simulation


## 🛠️ Proposed System Concept
The proposed APFC system continuously monitors the system power factor and compensates reactive power using a **binary-weighted capacitor bank** controlled by digital logic.

Key elements include:
- Real-time power factor measurement
- Adaptive control logic for capacitor switching
- Fine-grained reactive power compensation
- Scalable design suitable for commercial and industrial applications
